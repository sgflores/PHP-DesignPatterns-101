# PHP-DesignPatterns-101

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code. This repository will demonstrate simple PHP examples on how to implement each pattern.

# Why should we learn design patterns?
Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. Even if you never encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful because it teaches you how to solve all sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design.

# Classification of patterns
* Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
* Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.
* Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
